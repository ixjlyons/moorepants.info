Teaching Philosophy
===================

I am looking to settle at an educational institution that encourages, sustains,
and nurtures non-traditional engineering education paradigms. The traditional
engineering education process flows somewhat like the following:

1. Students sit through two years of lectures about fundamentals: calculus,
   physics, chemistry, etc. The "weeder" courses.
2. After the foundational knowledge has been gained, the students sit through
   one to two more years of specialized engineering lectures.
3. Finally, as a capstone in the last year the student is tasked with working
   on a research or industrial project where they apply all of their knowledge
   from their previous lectures. This may or may not be a team project.

This methodology has many problems. The students have to sit through at least
three years of lectures before they ever get to be engineers. Richard Miller of
Olin college compares engineering students to a student learning to be a
violinist. Can you imagine not playing the violin until your fourth year of
study? Why does it take students so long to realize what an engineer actually
is?  Students are capable of creating and engineering from day one and we
should nurture and promote that. Instead of weeding away the students, we
should build their capacity and love for engineering. We should make their
entire tenure (especially the first year!) full of fun and exciting projects,
that leave them begging for the tools and knowledge we usually have to shove
down their throats. Many of the students in traditional engineering curriculum
are only able to understand engineering by doing extracurricular projects (e.g.
various national competitions put together by academic societies). Why don't we
bring this into the classroom from the start and for *all* students.

We as engineers are often lectured at with little interaction in class, little
discussion, little team work, and little connection to the "real" world. In
many cases, this is very unfortunate because the world, whether industry or
education, is a collaborative environment that offers a multitude of learning
avenues. In the "real" world we discuss, we work together, we solve real
problems. Why not make the classroom the real world, instead of pretending it
is separate? There is no reason students cannot tackle real problems early in
their education. Few people can make extraordinary impacts in engineering own
their own, but many groups of people make great impacts each and everyday. I am
a strong advocate for collaborative interactive classrooms and I work hard to
create such classrooms.

So far, my teaching experience is based in the four teaching assistant
appointments I've had in the UC Davis MAE department, my work mentoring 15+
graduate and undergraduate students in a lab setting, leading action research
teams for the Education for Sustainable Living course at UC Davis, supervising
students in the UC Davis engineering machine shop, leading workshop series at
the Davis Bike Collective on bicycle repair for over 7 years, and teaching a a
large undergraduate engineering course at UC Davis. Through these I’ve been
exposed to a variety conventional and non-conventional teaching paradigms built
around collaborative education, high standards, and a engaging students of a
variety of learning styles and backgrounds. My resume details these efforts so
I'll only touch on the most recent course I have taught to demostrate my
teaching experience.

I have taught an introductory class to three dimensional thinking, engineering
graphics, design, and computer aided design. I was the teaching assistant for
the course in the Spring quarter of 2007 and as a lecturer taught the course in
the Fall of 2012. The course materials and details can be found on the `course
website`_.

.. _course website: http://mae.ucdavis.edu/~biosport/jkm/courses/eng4

This was a class of about 120 students, most were freshman and the course is
promoted as a good introductory class to mechanical engineering. I organized
the class much as it was previously taught by another professor, with two hours
of lecture per week and a three hour 30 person laboratory led by four TAs. I
was responsible for creating the curriculum for both the class and lab. My TAs
were encourage to work together to developing teaching materials for lab
sessions around the curriculum design. It is difficult to have a very
interactive classroom with that many students, but I made use of short team
assignements during class to have students engage with and learn from their
neighbors. I also used a combination of visual materials and in class sketching
examples to explain concepts. Students were assigned weekly readings and
sketching along with homework assignments to develop their mastery of that
week's material. The lab and lectures functioned somewhat independently, but
were designed to reinforce each other. The most difficult process was teaching
students how to think visually, especially if that hadn't done so before. Lots
of office hour time was spent working with students that had difficulties. I
also kept a strong focus on drawing and sketching in the lecture sections, as I
still see it as a fundamental skill for design. But the labs focused much more
strongly on computer aided visualization and design. Sketching and drawing by
hand remain one of the most effective ways of transferring and formalizing
ideas and shapes from ones mind. Some of the other teaching methods and tools
are:

- Developing three dimensional thinking through sketching.
- We followed the textbook
- Two one hour lectures given for 10 weeks.
- Two comprhensive in class exams.
- In class small group problem solving assignments (sketching).
- All lecture notes were posted online after each lecture with reuse
  permissions where possible.
- I developed a good portion of the visual materials myself, borrowed the rest
  from permissive online resources, and filled in the rest with the class text
  book.
- Extensive course website with syllabus, tutorials, and extra class related
  info.
- Extensive use of the Sakai (http://www.sakaiproject.org/) UCD software
  implementation to interact with and share materials with the students. This
  included email communication and chat room communication.
- Online assignment submission and grading to reduce dealing with paper.
- Regular office hours sessions for small group learning and appointments for
  individual meetings.
- I worked closely with the TAs to help them develop their lab sessions and
  teaching skills with weekly feedback to keep track of student progress.

What would I improve:
- print 3d objects have 3d props
- use 3d computer examples more

weird paragraph sitting here all alone:
The learning environment must also engage students through many teaching
techniques focused on connecting to the many different learning styles of
students. The lecture, homework, test method leaves too much to be desired and
fails too many students.

The final sections below detail some of other aspects of teaching that I have
hope to incoparate and also some class designs for undergraduates and
graduates.

Collaborative Teaching
----------------------

I am interesting collaborative teaching efforts, as a good team of teachers
will often complement each other and exceed what is provide by a singleton.
Yes, teachers all have their individual styles but this is no reason not to
harness the resources from many teachers that teach the same course while
developing plans, materials, and such. I would like to develop and foster
collaborative teaching groups around courses that span not only within our
small departments, but across other colleges around the world.

Grades
------

The undergraduate experience is highly focused on individual grades. The
successful students, in terms of our grade measure, are the ones who figure out
how to optimize their behavior for the grade. This optimization does not
necessarily include the aspects of engineering that we really want to get
across to students. Individual performance and scholastic aptitude are
certainly a way to evaluate someone's potential, but traditional grading
derived from tests and assignments fails to measure many of the other qualities
that will make successful engineers. Where possible, I'm for more qualitative
measures of a student's success and would not complain at all if traditional
grades could be left out of the picture altogether.

Technology
----------

Furthermore, expanding teaching techniques and the willingness to be
experimental are high priority for me. Students continue to absorb and learn in
a ways faster that we can keep up with, one of importance is through modern
technology. I’m advocate of utilizing technology in and out of the classroom
for collaboration and interactive learning. These methods range from social
media and collaborative software to class polling and open accessible content.
I plan to make strong use of the latest tools in the classroom. I also have
experience developing learning through teaching.

Learning to teach
-----------------

PhD students in engineering are typically not taught how to teach. We are
measured on our research and scholastic capabilities but not on our teaching
abilities, so our time is spent learning how to do the former rather than the
later. This is quite unfortunate because many of us are expected to be good
teachers in our post graduate careers. We've all had horrible teachers in our
undergraduate curriculum and these are a product of a broken system. This means
that if we want to be good and great teachers we have a lot to learn and must
do so on the job and through extra-curricular learning opportunities.
Workshops, readings, collaborative teaching, and mentor-mentee relationships
will be a core part of my continuing education on education.

Text books
----------

Expensive text books in which a new version is published every year will become
a thing of the past. The average semester/quarter cost of engineering text
books for a student can range from $300-$600. The publishing industry has made
this whole system a scam for both the students and the authors, with the
publishers reaping all the benefits. This basic knowledge that undergraduates
learn, should be available in an open and accessible form for no cost.
Wikipedia has shown us the power of the masses to create and maintain the most
authoritative text on the world's subjects. This should be no different for text
books. The classes I teach will be accompanied by a collaboratively created
text book that will morph and change throughout the years. The materials will
be created by both the teachers and the students and will not be limited by
what can be put on paper, but will take advantage of the power of the world
wide web and the latest internet technologies. Successful examples of things of
this nature include UC Davis's ChemWiki_, NanoHub_, Connexions_, and WikiBooks_.

Project Based Learning
----------------------

Young students have a deep reservoir for passion and we as teachers help that
flourish as early in the engineering curriculum as possible. One way to do this
is to give students real life problems to solve and have them use the power of
team work to create and innovate solutions.

Course Ideas
------------

Their are many classes that I am interested in teaching. In terms of
undergraduate courses I am well equipped to teach dynamics, control,
bio-mechanics, vehicle dynamics, mixed system dynamics with bond graphs, and
aircraft dynamics but am adaptable to any courses in general mechanical
engineering curriculum. I also have a personal interest to develop
undergraduates programming and software development skills at a early stage. I
believe that engineering curriculum glosses over these skills, leaving students
to flounder and develop extremely poor programming practices, even though
engineers are called on to analyze data and be experts in scientific computing.
An early start at good practices in programming will save large amounts of time
in the future and set students up to be marketable for the web generation.

As far a graduate classes are concerned, I’m interested in teaching advanced
multi-body dynamics and in particular developing students knowledge of Kane’s
method and using symbolic computational software for efficient derivation of
symbolic equations of motion. I’ve been involved in the development of software
to do so and have plans to engage students in software design with respect to
this. I am of the opinion that engineering curriculum is often weak in the
development of statistical analyses for experiments. I’d like to teach a course
on design of experiments that will give graduate students the tools and know
how to work with the massive amounts of experimental data that inevitably
carries with it much error. I'd also like to teach a graduate level version of
software design for science. Big data is at our door step and engineers will
need to be able to deal with big data to solve our next generation of
engineering problems. Good system identification courses are often hard to come
by. I'd like to develop one that is founded and linked to machine learning and
big data problems.

Bicycle Dynamics
................

Lastly, I’m interested in developing a course modeled after a colleague in
Spain that centers are the bicycle. The bicycle is an interestingly rich
dynamic and control problem. The class would be design to emulate the
scientific process, essentially provided a canned, but complex, dynamic system
to model, measure and validate with experimentation. The bicycle offers an
economical and tractable platform for learning about the whole picture in
experimentation.

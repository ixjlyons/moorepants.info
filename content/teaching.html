Teaching Philosophy
===================

I am looking to settle at an educational institution that encourages, sustains,
and nurtures non-traditional engineering education paradigms. The traditional
engineering education process flows somewhat like the following:

1. Students sit through two years of lectures about fundamentals: calculus,
   physics, chemistry, etc. The "weeder" courses.
2. After the foundational knowledge has been gained, the students sit through
   one to two more years of specialized engineering lectures.
3. Finally, as a capstone in the last year the student is tasked with working
   on a research or industrial project where they apply all of their knowledge
   from their previous lectures. This may or may not be a team project.

This methodology has many problems. The students have to sit through at least
three years of lectures before they ever get to be engineers. Richard Miller of
Olin college compares engineering students to a student learning to be a
violinist. Can you imagine not playing the violin until your fourth year of
study? Why does it take students so long to realize what an engineer actually
is?  Students are capable of creating and engineering from day one and we
should nurture and promote that. Instead of weeding away the students, we
should build their capacity and love for engineering. We should make their
entire tenure (especially the first year!) full of fun and exciting projects,
that leave them begging for the tools and knowledge we usually have to shove
down their throats. Many of the students in traditional engineering curriculum
are only able to understand engineering by doing extracurricular projects (e.g.
various national competitions). Why don't we bring this into the classroom from
the start and for *all* students.

We as engineers are often lectured at with little interaction in class, little
discussion, little team work, and little connection to the "real" world. In
many cases, this is very unfortunate because the world, whether industry or
education, is a collaborative world that offers a multitude of learning
avenues. In the "real" world we discuss; we work together; we solve real
problems. Why not make the classroom the real world, instead of pretending it
is separate. Very few single people make extraordinary impacts in engineering,
but very many groups of people make great impacts each and everyday. I am
strong advocate for collaborative interactive classrooms and intend mine to be
as such.

The learning environment must also engage students through many teaching
techniques focused on connecting to the many different learning styles of
students. The lecture, homework, test method leaves too much to be desired and
fails too many students.

Grades
------

The undergraduate experience is highly focused on individual grades. The
successful students, in terms of our grade measure, are the ones who figure out
how to optimize their behavior for the grade. This optimization does not
necessarily include the aspects of engineering that we really want to get
across to students. Individual performance and scholastic aptitude are
certainly a way to evaluate someone's potential, but traditional grading
derived from tests and assignments fails to measure many of the other qualities
that will make successful engineers. Where possible, I'm for more qualitative
measures of a student's success and would not complain at all if traditional
grades could be left out of the picture altogether.

Collaborative Teaching
----------------------

I am interesting collaborative teaching efforts, as a good team of teachers
will often complement each other and exceed what is provide by a singleton.
Yes, teachers all have their individual styles but this is no reason not to
harness the resources from many teachers that teach the same course while
developing plans, materials, and such. I would like to develop and foster
collaborative teaching groups around courses that span not only within our
small departments, but across other colleges around the world.

Experience
----------

So far, my teaching experience is based in the four teaching assistant
appointments I've had in the UC Davis MAE department, my work mentoring 15+
graduate and undergraduate students in a lab setting, leading action research
teams for the Education for Sustainable Living course at UC Davis, instructing
students in the UC Davis engineering machine shop, leading workshop series at
the Davis Bike Collective on bicycle repair for over 7 years, and teaching a a
large undergraduate course in engineering. Through these I’ve been exposed to a
variety conventional and non-conventional teaching paradigms built around
collaborative education, high standards and a engaging students of a variety of
learning styles.

Technology
----------

Furthermore, expanding teaching techniques and the willingness to be
experimental are high priority for me. Students continue to absorb and learn in
a ways faster that we can keep up with, one of importance is through modern
technology. I’m advocate of utilizing technology in and out of the classroom
for collaboration and interactive learning. These methods range from social
media and collaborative software to class polling and open accessible content.
I plan to make strong use of the latest tools in the classroom. I also have
experience developing learning through teaching.

Learning to teach
-----------------

PhD students in engineering are typically not taught how to teach. We are
measured on our research and scholastic capabilities but not on our teaching
abilities, so our time is spent learning how to do the former rather than the
later. This is quite unfortunate because many of us are expected to be good
teachers in our post graduate careers. We've all had horrible teachers in our
undergraduate curriculum and these are a product of a broken system. This means
that if we want to be good and great teachers we have a lot to learn and must
do so on the job and through extra-curricular learning opportunities.
Workshops, readings, collaborative teaching, and mentor-mentee relationships
will be a core part of my continuing education on education.

Text books
----------

Expensive text books in which a new version is published every year will become
a thing of the past. The average semester/quarter cost of engineering text
books for a student can range from $300-$600. The publishing industry has made
this whole system a scam for both the students and the authors, with the
publishers reaping all the benefits. This basic knowledge that undergraduates
learn, should be available in an open and accessible form for no cost.
Wikipedia has shown us the power of the masses to create and maintain the most
authoritative text on the world's subjects. This should be no different for text
books. The classes I teach will be accompanied by a collaboratively created
text book that will morph and change throughout the years. The materials will
be created by both the teachers and the students and will not be limited by
what can be put on paper, but will take advantage of the power of the world
wide web and the latest internet technologies. Successful examples of things of
this nature include UC Davis's ChemWiki_, NanoHub_, Connexions_, and WikiBooks_.

Project Based Learning
----------------------

Young students have a deep reservoir for passion and we as teachers help that
flourish as early in the engineering curriculum as possible. One way to do this
is to give students real life problems to solve and have them use the power of
team work to create and innovate solutions.

Partial Credit
--------------

Should we give it? The real world doesn't accept partial credit.

Course Ideas
------------

Their are many classes that I am interested in teaching. In terms of
undergraduate courses I am well equipped to teach dynamics, control,
bio-mechanics, vehicle dynamics, mixed system dynamics with bond graphs, and
aircraft dynamics but am adaptable to any courses in general mechanical
engineering curriculum. I also have a personal interest to develop
undergraduates programming and software development skills at a early stage. I
believe that engineering curriculum glosses over these skills, leaving students
to flounder and develop extremely poor programming practices, even though
engineers are called on to analyze data and be experts in scientific computing.
An early start at good practices in programming will save large amounts of time
in the future and set students up to be marketable for the web generation.

As far a graduate classes are concerned, I’m interested in teaching advanced
multi-body dynamics and in particular developing students knowledge of Kane’s
method and using symbolic computational software for efficient derivation of
symbolic equations of motion. I’ve been involved in the development of software
to do so and have plans to engage students in software design with respect to
this. I am of the opinion that engineering curriculum is often weak in the
development of statistical analyses for experiments. I’d like to teach a course
on design of experiments that will give graduate students the tools and know
how to work with the massive amounts of experimental data that inevitably
carries with it much error. I'd also like to teach a graduate level version of
software design for science. Big data is at our door step and engineers will
need to be able to deal with big data to solve our next generation of
engineering problems. Good system identification courses are often hard to come
by. I'd like to develop one that is founded and linked to machine learning and
big data problems.

Bicycle Dynamics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lastly, I’m interested in developing a course modeled after a colleague in
Spain that centers are the bicycle. The bicycle is an interestingly rich
dynamic and control problem. The class would be design to emulate the
scientific process, essentially provided a canned, but complex, dynamic system
to model, measure and validate with experimentation. The bicycle offers an
economical and tractable platform for learning about the whole picture in
experimentation.

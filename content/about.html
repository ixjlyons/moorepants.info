So you want to know about me. Well, I'll tell you one thing about me. When I
turned sixteen, I inherited a 1977 Plymouth Arrow from my grandfather, Garland
(Runt) Moore, "Pop" to me. He inherited this car from his son, Keith, who
passed away about a month after I was born at the age of 23 from some nasty
cancer. I was named after Keith; my middle name, that is. The seats in the
Arrow were black vinyly and would get super hot in the summer time, as would
the engine. But that sure was a fun little hatchback car. I painted a giant
Autobots symbol on the hood and hooked up some ear deafening speakers to pump
out the glory of the punk rock music that I'd recently discovered. It became a
portable stereo system for the skateparks and skate spots around southern
Piedmont Virginia and northern North Carolina. I used to ride with my grandpa,
Pop, in that car when I was young. After we were seated, he'd always turn to
me, pat me on the left leg, and give my leg a mighty squeeze with a big grin on
his face. He didn't say much, the stroke and all, but even though that squeeze
hurt like the dickens, I'd smile back and expect one every time I got in that
car. Too bad he didn't make till I was sixteen and would have been in the
driver's seat, where I could repay the love.

I am a person
=============

I hail from Virginia where the moonshine flowed like water and our summers were
spent running through the tobacco fields. I skateboarded my way through high
school and moved to the big city of Norfolk to learn some bits about machines
and equations. After racing small formula cars and sitting in tunnel traffic
all too many hours, the bicycle entered my life. What an amazing, even perfect
machine. After the military shrouded city started to get old, I dropped the car
and made my way to the bicycle capital of the United States out in sunny
California. Little gold was to be found, but lots of like minded intelligent
folks were in abundance. The Bike Church of Davis was my first calling, after
running from my Southern Baptist upbringing. I got ordained as a Reverend and
somehow in my spare time obtained a Master's and Ph.D. about riding on
bicycles. It sounds silly at first, but wow is the bicycle an engineering
device rich in possibilities for learning. That's what I've done, learn.

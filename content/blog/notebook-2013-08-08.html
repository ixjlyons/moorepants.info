Plone
=====

I got the website running on the server today. Been taking detailed notes which
will be pushed to a github repo soon.

I went with the option of installing Plone with the unified installer on the
server and I plan to overwrite the default buildout config files with the ones
I've been developing with Aspeli's book so that I have control over the
details. But damn Plone is a hug nasty mess with so many freaking settings and
options. I don't know how anyone keeps it all straight unless they do this
every day of their lives. I hope it is all worth it. I really like using Plone
and have good experiences in the past with it, but developing it is another
story. Seems like you could write a Plone CloneÂ® with a modern web app
framework and drop all this old baggage. I assume it isn't an easy thing to do
though since noone has done it.

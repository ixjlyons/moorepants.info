I've been meaning to catch up on many long lost years of the developments in
web technologies. This paired with the fact that I need a space to flush my
digital life was the impetus and my looming job search to make a new website. I
finally have found some time to create a new personal website. `My old one
<http://mae.ucdavis.edu/~biosport/jkm/>`_ has served its purpose and is
starting to get antiquated, especially since I never update it (it's not that
fun to update mainly due it being built with a ten year old version of
DreamWeaver).

I started learning about website creation in my high school years (1995-2000)
with the likes of Geocities and Fortunecity and Netscape Navigator. My first
website was called the "The Jive" (after seeing the words on a cool sweatshirt
this blck guy with the Kid flatop was wearing. It was a four color rainbow with
Jive written over it in white). I primarily used the website to post
information about all the cartoons I watched as a child in the 80's
(Transformers, Bravestar, Thundercats, He-Man, etc). I blatantly posted tons of
copyrighted material from VHS tapes I had recorded of the shows. But The Jive
taught me about HTML and was certainly the first seed for any interests in
programming that I would have years later.

I used these skills to create several websites over the years following high
school, but getting a Bachelors and Masters in mechanical engineering left me
no time to keep up with the rapid pace that the web was developing. By the time
I looked at websites again, everything had become a completely different and
extremely more complex system.

I finally got around to fiddling with modern websites about four years ago when
I started learning about various content management systems and website
generators such as Plone, Joomla, Wordpress, Blogger, etc. I learned to get
these up and running to use them but still had little idea of what made them
tick.

My programming chops started to grow once my labmate, Luke, convinced me to
move beyon Matlab and test the waters with Python about 3 years ago. Since then
I've slowly picked up more and more about what the modern web is all about but
still haven't had much time to try creating something of any complexitity.

This new personal site is my first step with getting to grips with at least the
front end side of modern web development. I'm using the static site generator,
Hyde, to create the site and parring it with Twitter's popular boostrap
framework (forgive me for having another Boostrap looking website, once I
figure out my design a bit I'll try to move away from the standard look). The
source is versioned with Git and hosted on Github.

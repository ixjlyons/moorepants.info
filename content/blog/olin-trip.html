This past week I had the very fortunate opportunity to visit a very remarkable
place. I met `Allen Downey`_ this summer at SciPy when he helped out with our
PyDy tutorial. Allen is a professor of computer science at the `Frank W. Olin
College of Engineering`_ and he invited me out to learn about Olin and, in
particular, their Senior Capstone Program in Engineering (SCOPE). I almost did
not go because I am busy preparing for my work for my new position at UC Davis,
but that would have been a serious mistake on my part. My short experience at
Olin was very powerful and helped me reaffirm my convictions with respect to
engineering and education. Olin is place I would have never imagined existing.
Each and every experience I had there seemed like another one of my fantasies
come to life. Unlike every other institution I've experienced, Olin breeds a
culture of change and innovation in education. Professors and students alike
have the freedom to plow their own way with minimal barriers and loads of
support.

Culture
=======

The most profound thing was not the project based learning, the interactive
courses, collaboration, their successful capstone effort, or the unique
curriculum, but the culture that has been cultivated and nutured by the
instituion. At Olin, the students are partners in their education, not simply
products of the college. The relationships the students have with the
professors is unheard of. Professors are referred to by their first names and
dine with the students at the mess hall each day. The relationship is founded
on mutual trust and respect. At lunch on the first day of my visit I wasn't
greeted by faculty members in ties, but three thoughtful and energetic students
who shared their learning experiences and projects with me.

I also witnessed a sophomore student's meeting with a professor where she was
requesting to define a new degree focus to meet her and her friends educational
desires. It was like witnessing a cordial professional conversation between two
faculty members. The maturity and care were beyond evident. Olin has fostered
the culture from day one and provide a nest where the students can find their
on wings.

Students create own courses

Another cultural difference that was refreshing was that the faculty seem to
actually collaborate extensively on curriculum and course design and
implementation. Courses are co-taught and co-designed

Finally, the mission of Olin includes the explicit call to constantly change.
The curriculum always has an expiration date and because change is a goal
barriers to change are minimized or removed entirely. Faculty and students are
encouraged to 

Curriculum
==========

The curriculum at Olin forgoes the typical layered set of requisites for a
model they refer to as "streams". These streams provide unique paths students
can follow towards their educational goals. One defining part of this is the lack of the
foundational core courses that traditional programs have (i.e. calculus,
physics, chemistry, etc). Instead the curriculum is designed around courses
that put students in to the shoes of the designer and engineer from day one. The
project based courses fuel the intrinsic motivation inside the students and the
"core" elements are fed in only when students need and ask for it. Some of this
was even taken to the extreme. For example, first year students learn to
simulate complex systems potentially without understanding fully what
differential equations are or anything about their analytical solutions. These
methods of education are debated among the faculty and one professor admitted
to me that Olin students likely have weaknesses in formulating the quick "back
of the napkin" type solutions to problems.

Lack of "core prerequisties
75% of courses are common to all majors

SCOPE

I visited to learn most about Olin's capstone project course, called SCOPE.
What struck me most about the senior capstone was that it wasn't regulated to
the students' final year. SCOPE starts the day the students begin school. Most
of the courses are project centered and many are collaborative. In particular,
in the sophomore year the students take "Principles of Engineering". In this
course, the students have to collaboratively devise and implement an
elecotromehcnial device (e.g. automated milkshake maker, robotic dodge ball
player). The scale and scope of these projects are very similar
to a traidation senior deisng projects. The most valuable thing about having
this expereinece at the sophomore level si that the students get practice
implementing a real project and understanding failure. The course not only
teaches students about collaboration and design, but how to effectibely manage
and execute a project with limited resources and time. This "trial" senior
project sets up the students for success when they are working with a company
doing a real project during their final year.

They teach how to recover

- Olin spends significant resources and time to develop strong relationships
  with companies.
- Industrial relevant problem has to come from outside campus.
- SCOPE is an entire year program (~8 months).
- Each company that particiaptes pays $55k and the students are expected to
  deliver a real solution to the company. But only a report is guaranteed.
- Teams are between 4-6 people depending on the problem.
- The faculty and companies work hard to choose appropriate problems for the
  students. The problems should be ones that would make a big difference at the
  company but that they may not have the resources to work on. It shouldn't be
  a mission ciritical problem.
- Students are polled in their junior year for their interstes and companies
  are chosen that fit the students.
- Teams are selected by an algorithm.
- SCOPE summit at end
- NDAs (cross sign)
- Agile/Scrum (2-3 week sprints) focus on process instead of product
- interdisplin
- faculty are guides, students lead and utlize the company (as a contractor
  would)
- bi-weekly design reviews
- company provides: money, time, knowledge, opportunity, and trust
- studetns get private workign space

SCOPE is very focused on students that want to pursue careers enterpreunial
compaines. But they also have an alternative project called ADE that is setup
for students that want careers in the non-profit sector. ADE is a longer
program than SCOPE where the stduents work with a stakeholder in a community of
need and implement a *sutainable* project. They attempt ensure sustainabilty by
devevloping a locally driven businees plan.

Classroom are not lecture halls

I saw little sign of lecture halls at Olin. Every class I was invited to attend
was setup as group work tables that were more than likely easily recofigurable
to shape the learning space as needed.

Design of Nature: break the high school programming
First weeks: learn how to operate machines in the shop
Clocks are all set to the wrong time
Provide scaffolding to show how to do a project, not what
Students "pull" info from facult instead of faculty "pushing"
NINJAS

Negatives

- all model students, can we do this for the average or below average engineer
- most engineers in industry are doing mundane repittive crap
- olin is in an upper class suburb
- studnet knew complex things from high school

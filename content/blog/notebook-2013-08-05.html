Amazon Web Services
===================

Woohoo! Looks like Amazon can invoice us and I finally turned in all the
purchasing papers to make this happen. Maybe I'll have the website online by
the end of the week.

Matlab
======

I requested a quote for 5 academic group licenses with 4 toolboxes but the rep
is on vacation so this may not come back till next week.

MGView
======

Adam Leeper released MGView under the MIT license today so Tarun and I are
looking into potentially using it for pydy-viz and giving our efforts to
contributions to the project. See his repo on github:
https://github.com/mgview/mgview

Plone
=====

I finished Chapter 8 but hit a bug which I'm trying to get an answer to on the
Plone user's mailing list. Martin replied, so I'll probably get to the bottom
of it.

I started a mockup using bootstrap and html5 boilerplate for the new site theme:

.. image:: {{ media_url('images/hmc-initial-mockup.png') }}
   :class: img-rounded

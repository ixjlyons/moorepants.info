Matlab
======

Matlab has two academic licenses: group and concurrent. I was mistakenly
calling the group license "academic" earlier. The group licenses register your
computer's mac address on activation so running a dual boot machine with Matlab
on both Windows and Linux will work because they will both have the same Mac
address. But running in a virtual machine's OS could be problematic because the
Virtual Machine generates a new mac address for each OS that is running. So if
you activate Matlab on your real machine and then on the virtual machine you
will have an issue unless you can make your virtual machine mac address the
same as your real machine's max address. Theorectically you can install Matlab
on many virtual machines that have the same MAC addresses, but just not run the
virtual machines at the same time on the same computer. I think this can be
done.

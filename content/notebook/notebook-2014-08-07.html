A
=

- Read and organized Tim/Jack's predictive sim code.
- Completed an opensim planar walking model that matches Gait2D.
- Discussed dynamics software with Sherm.
- Mentored GSoC students and prepared for final two weeks. Contributed to a
  System class to help Tarun move forward.
- Met twice with Jack Wang and once with Ajay about utilizing Jack's work along
  with my data. Less clear now if there is anything worth doing there.
- Read Tim, Jack et al's preprint.
- Hashed out an opensim computational plan for direct collocation system id on
  a planar walking model with gait gain scheduled full state feedback torque
  control. Got Ajay's advice on this.
- Learned the basics of using the eigen C++ lib.
- Built a simbody conda package.

O
=

- Run extensive tests on the inverted pendulum system id system and summarize
  the method's abilities to identify the controller for a variety of # of
  degrees of freedom, initial guesses, measurement noise, discretization
  intervals and simulation durations. The idea is to make sure that the scale
  of the gait control id problem can be solved.
- Complete the controller implementation in opensim.
- Start on the direct collocation code: data loading, objective func, etc.
- Learn some about O(n) multibody dynamics with Sherm.

I
=

- Still haven't successfully compiled Opensim with working Python bindings. The
  SWIG stuff eats up about all the memory on my machine so it is painful to
  compile it. Started work on binary installers for simbody and opensim for the
  conda package manager with Chris to address this (for others at least).
- Floundered around in idea space and didn't make much progress on implementing
  an opensim system id approach.
- Slow movement in C++ development.

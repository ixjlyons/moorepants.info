In the summer of 2007 I traveled to San Andr√©s Itzapa to work with Maya Pedal.
Maya Pedal is a non-profit Guatemalan run appropriate technology center
focusing on pedal powered machines. I worked with Carlos, the chief designer
and fabricator, Johanna, the adminstrator, and several other volunteers from
around the world.  We did facilities upgrades, bicycle mantainence, machine
fabrication, and machine design.

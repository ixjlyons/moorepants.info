I led a group of students from UC Davis in an Action Research Team for the
Education for Sustainable Living Program. The ART was put together to idenifty
a need for a pedal powered machine on campus and then to design, construct, and
implement the machine. The students decided to build a pedal powered desk that
would allow students to power their laptops while working at a comfortable desk
enviromment.

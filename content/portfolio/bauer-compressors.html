I worked at `Bauer Compressors`_ in Norfolk, Virginia as an intern for the good
part of a year. I mostly spent my time creating solid models of existing parts
with Autodesk Inventor. At first, I drew hundreds of compressor hose fittings,
but eventually modeled several full sized compressors. After modeling all these
things, I got to do some design work making mounting brackets, resizing air
tank storage containers, and developing a passive oil/air seperator. I
unfortunately lost the screenshots of all of my material from Bauer except
these two images of the first compressor that I modeled. John Dwyer was my
immediate supervisor and can vouch for my work there.

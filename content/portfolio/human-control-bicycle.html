My graduate work at UC Davis was rounded out with a project that focused on
identifying the control actions and model employed by a human during simple
manuevers. I constructed a heavily instrumented bicycle and collected a great
deal of data during a series of experiments in which the rider attempted to
balance a bicycle under lateral perturbations. This data was then used to
identify both a plant and control model of the underlying system and validate
our hypostheses about the rider's control structure. The work is detailed both
in `my dissertation`_ and `my lab's website`_.

Future Idea Snippets
--------------------

- Use a Kalman filter to generate the angles, rates, and accelerations of the
system and then run the M, C, K linear least squares fitting routine to data.
This may give more consistentcy between the angles, rates, and accels and lower
the uncertainity in the identified parameters in the plant id.
- Setup up an optimization problem that maximizes our analytic handling quality
metric with respect to the bicycle's physical parameters. If lucky, this could
spit out some unusual type of optimal vehicle. This concept leads to deriving
vehicle designs from optimization instead of human intuition and experience.

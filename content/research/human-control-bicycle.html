My graduate work at UC Davis was rounded out with a project that focused on
identifying the control actions and model employed by a human during simple
manuevers. I constructed a heavily instrumented bicycle and collected a great
deal of data during a series of experiments in which the rider attempted to
balance a bicycle under lateral perturbations. This data was then used to
identify both a plant and control model of the underlying system and validate
our hypostheses about the rider's control structure. The work is detailed both
in `my dissertation`_ and `my lab's website`_.

Research Statement
==================

If one word can represent the glue in my research ideas and intentions it would
be "human". With a mechanical engineering focus, I'm mostly concerned with
various ways humans interact with machines and act as machines. The past
decades of mechanical engineering advancement have brought us great strides in
automatic control and machine design. But this body of research often neglects
that humans are still and will be for the foreseeable future an integrable part
of machines. Machines will need to become more and more aware of the human's
actions and intentions, complementing the higher cerebral control that
computers cannot yet demonstrate with the massive data parsing and repetitive
tasks that computers excel at. We must understand the human to better interact
with its environment which is starting to include more advanced vehicles,
environments, machines, and software. The more we understand how the human
behaves the better these devices can be designed to complement the human's
strengths.

My doctoral dissertation work focused on the human's unique ability to balance
a mostly unstable vehicle, the bicycle. The bicycle control problem is an ideal
platform for investigating many, if not all, of the facets of complex human
control and complementary machine design, all in a tractable, economically
viable, and familiar machine. On-board data acquisition has improved
dramatically with the advent of micro and nano sensor and data collection
abilities that are being pushed by the smart phone industry, which is helping
propel engineering into a big data field. This sensor and data collection
allowed me to collect substantial amounts of data from both the bicycle and the
human subject in maneuvering experiments. I made use of a combination of first
principles modeling techniques and grey box system identification approaches to
develop realistic models of both the bicycle and the human's control behavior.
This research is covered in detail in my `dissertation
<http://moorepants.github.com/dissertation>`_ and a series of journal and
conference papers found in my resume.

My doctoral work has built my aptitude in a broad range of theoretical and
experimental sub-disciplines which include:

- Multibody dynamics and classical mechanics
- Classical and modern automatic control systems
- System identification
- Signal processing
- Human biomechanics
- Human operator control (i.e. manual control)
- Vehicle dynamics (single track vehicles, automobiles, and aircraft)
- Aircraft dynamics and control
- Vehicle handling qualities
- Open source software engineering and agile development
- Statistical modeling
- Machine design
- Sports engineering
- Appropriate technology
- Human powered machines
- Wind tunnel experimentation
- Mobile instrumentation

My future research directions are going to leverage collaborative initiatives
to fill in the gaps in my expertise with the intent of developing a more
holistic research plan centered around the human as a controller and his or her
interactions with machines. In particular, collaboration and connection to the
fields of cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning will be a
priority. The prediction of human behavior in a machine interaction sense
requires greater understanding of the mind and the complexities of the human's
internal control scheme.

My primary goal will be to assemble a team of scientists (students, post docs,
and fellow colleagues) to tackle research fundamental concepts in our
understanding of the human's control system and the machines that the human
interacts with. The applications are wide ranged but the research will
primarily focus on the basics of human motor control from simple balance to
manipulator control and vehicle control. I am interested in pushing the
boundaries into biofeedback in automatic control systems and the controller's
operator "awareness".

Questions I plan to seek answers for include: When does the automatic take
control of the vehicle if the human isn't up to the control task? Can automatic
control constantly be aware of the human's state such that it can adapt to the
human's ability or inability? Can machines become aware of their surroundings
such that they never harm a human? Automatic control of manually controlled
systems must be able to augment the human's actions both enhancing their ability
and filling in when the human loses the ability to be an adequate controller.
It should be aware of the environment when the human cannot be.

In my tenure as a graduate student researcher I have already gained a great
deal of experience in project management, student mentoring, and successful
grant writing. The final years of my graduate work was funded by an National
Science Foundation grant, of which I played a large role in writing and
managing under my principal investigators. Combining this with successful
grants from the Department of State (Fulbright), many local UC Davis grants,
and two Google Summer of Code grants, I feel quite prepared to secure funding
and management a large lab and several research projects.

Research Proposals
==================

The following sections give brief proposals for research projects ideas that I
have in mind.

Manual Control and Human Machine Interaction
--------------------------------------------

I'd like to explore the human as a machine controller for very fundamental
problems. For example, how do we balance a broom stick on our hand? What is the
fundamental sensory information that we take in, how we process that, and
produce the correct control action. Developing experiments around simple
input/output relationships with machines and software can help expose the
essence of human control.

In contrast to simple systems and first principles modeling constructs, the
collection of a large amount of varying dynamic data from forces and kinematics
to psychological inputs combined with machine learning and system
identification will allow for the development of predictive models of human
control behavior in both simple and complex tasks.

Balance
-------

One of the most fundamental control tasks we do as a human is to balance.
Balancing is learned at a very young age when it is a task that dominates the
frontal cortex computations but which becomes a learned skill which moves to
the spinal cord. I'd like to study details of postural control and the way in
which we learn the skill through carefully crafted experiments that can expose
the sensory motor control the human uses in balancing.

Single Track Vehicle Dynamics
-----------------------------

Single track vehicles such as bicycles, motorcycles, unicycles offer a unique
platform to study and understand human control. These vehicles limit the
human's input sources to affect the vehicles behavior which allow for more
controlled input/output experimental relationships to be studied. Furthermore
the vehicles themselves have non-trivial open loop dynamics which provides a
rich system for exposing the human's unique control abilities such as
non-minimum phase, instability, disturbance recovery, and directional/tracking
control.

Vehicle and Machine Handling Qualities
--------------------------------------

When human's interact with machines whether it be flying an aircraft or playing
a video game there is feel, a subjective opinion on the ease of control. Does
the machine do what I want it to with minimal effort? The performance while
completing a task with a manually controlled machine and the machines open loop
dynamics can be objectively measured. There must be connections between the
subjective feeling and the objective measurements. Unlocking this connection
will allow for the design of machines that compliment the human in a passive
way and in combination with automatic control will allow machines to adapt the
machine's dynamics in response to the human's desires. But understanding what
makes a machine easy to control will take an interdisciplinary approach that
involves an understanding of dynamics, control, neuroscience, and psychology.

Vehicle Model Software and Database
-----------------------------------

Scientists create models of vehicles constantly. There are well known models
like the "bicycle" model for cars, the Pacjeka automobile tire model, the
Whipple bicycle model, the Sharp motorcycle model, etc. The currently
availability of free an unhindered use of these models detracts from the
scientific community being able to trust and reproduce results. A large
database that allows models to developed, submitted, and validated for easy
reuse will allow models to validated against data on a large scale. I'd like to
start with vehicle models, but this concept can extend to any system described
by differential equations and such. Modeling languages like Modelica provide
some of the framework needed to make this a reality.

Vehicle Simulation Database
---------------------------

Dynamic data is constantly collected on different vehicles but is only stored
locally on scientists' computers. If there were an easy way to stored time
series measurements with accompanying meta data, a large database of
simulations could be built up. This would allow modelers to validate their
models against thousands and thousands of simulations. In my field, most models
are accepted after being validated on only a tiny set of data. Imagine if you
could validate your model on huge datasets of simulations.

Bicycle Tire Modeling
---------------------

The rigid body dynamics of bicycles and motorcycles have advanced enough for
relatively good prediction abilities, but the most glaring deficiency is models
that can accurately predict the ground reaction forces between a tire and the
surface that it is rolling on. I'm interested in creating large amounts of tire
force data and identifying models for validation and creation of first
principles models.

Open Source Software
--------------------

The academic needs powerful cutting edges computation tools at his or her
disposal. In academia, I believe that these tools are best provided by open
source software that is collaboratively developed among the leading scientists
and thus users in the field. The nature of open source software parallels the
idea of reproducible, reusable science. I've spent a great deal of time working
on open source software as a tightly knit companion to my research. All of my
research will have open source software as an integral component and here are
some specific examples of projects:

- Dynamics (problem development, simulation, and visualization)
- Symbolic equation of motion generation for dynamic systems
- Control Systems
- System Identification

I'm interested in developing reusable, highly tested open source software
suites that leverage cloud computing resources to solve big problems in my
field, but to have the software general enough that many other fields can make
use of it and contribute.

Big Data For Engineers
----------------------

The world wide web has caught on to the big data movement and it drives
prediction and analyses on a grand scale, but much of the engineering world is
still behind the times. It is obvious that the more data we collect about
systems in the world, the more realistic and predictive our models can become.
We now have the capability for data driven models and predictions of physical
phenomena by making use of vast database stores and cloud powered computing
resources. Engineering needs to embrace this and make big data widely
accessible to engineers so that society can more rapidly make great strides in
solving problems. All of my future work will have a data component that
supports this idea.

Human Inertia
-------------

I'd like to develop more realistic mathematical models for human inertia.
Current rigid body models do not accurately model the human inertia around the
joints when in arbitrary configurations. The need for more complex volumetric
equations defining the flexible regions around the primary joints can increase
the accuracy of human inertia estimation in arbitrary configurations. These
models which have low computational and measurement latency should be validated
against more detailed and time consuming measurement techniques like MRI and
vibration analyses.

Human power
-----------

Humans are power generators and there are a great deal of ways to efficiently
make use of the human's mechanical power generation abilities to do work.
Human's have long used tools of various efficiencies for agriculture and food
processing. Making these processes most efficient are still important for much
of the developing world. Improves in efficiency of tasks such as transporting
people and goods, moving water, grinding raw foods, washing clothes, etc are
all possible. But also with the advent of extremely low power electronics (less
than 5w) the human's excess power can potentially keep things like cell phones,
pace makers, an small computers powered.

Energetics of Transportation
----------------------------

Transportation research and modeling techniques do not always take full
advantage of the predictive ability of the laws of motion. Utilizing
simulations of dynamically constrained systems can add great insight in
understanding transportation systems and giving results that are useful to
engineers, planners, and policy makers.

- Speed limits per vehicle kinetic energy
- GPS controlled speed limits
- Self drving cars
- Efficient route choices based on the energetics of travel
- Fuel economy feedback reformulated with energy economy in mind

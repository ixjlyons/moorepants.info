Research Statement
==================

If one word can represent the glue in my research ideas and intentions it would
be "human". With a mechanical engineering focus, I'm mostly concerned with
various ways humans interact with machines. The past decades of mechanical
engineering advancement have brought us great strides in automatic control and
machine design. But this body of research often neglects that humans are still
and will be for the foreseeable future an integrable part of machines.
Machines will need to become more and more aware of the human's actions and
intentions, complementing the higher cerebral control that computers cannot yet
demonstrate with the massive data parsing and repetitive tasks that computers
excel at. We must understand the human to better interact with its environment
which is starting to include more advanced vehicles, environments, machines,
and software. The more we understand how the human works the better these
devices can be designed to complement the human's strengths.

My doctoral dissertation work focused on the human's unique ability to balance
a mostly unstable vehicle, the bicycle. The bicycle control problem is an ideal
platform for investigating many, if not all of the facets of complex human
control and complementary machine design, all in a tractable, economically
viable, and familiar machine. On-board data acquisition has improved
dramatically with the advent of tiny sensor and data collection abilities that
are being pushed by the smartphone industry, which is helping propel
engineering into a big data field. This sensor and data collection allowed me
to collect substantial amounts of data from both the bicycle and the human
subject in maneuvering experiments. I made use of a combination of first
principles modeling techniques and grey box system identification approaches to
develop realistic models of both the bicycle and the human's control behavior.
This research is covered in detail in my `dissertation
<http://moorepants.github.com/dissertation>`_ and a series of journal and
conference papers found in my resume.

My doctoral work has built my aptitude in a broad range of theoretical and
experimental sub-disciplines which include:

- Multibody dynamics and classical mechanics
- Classical and modern automatic control systems
- System identification
- Signal processing
- Human biomechanics
- Human operator control (i.e. manual control)
- Vehicle dynamics (single track vehicles, automobiles, and aircraft)
- Aircraft dynamics and control
- Vehicle handling qualities
- Open source software engineering and agile development
- Statistical modeling
- Machine design
- Sports engineering
- Appropriate technology
- Human powered machines
- Wind tunnel experimentation
- Mobile instrumentation

My future research directions are going to leverage collaborative initiatives
to fill in the gaps in my expertise with the intent of developing a more
holistic research plan centered around the human as a controller and his or her
interactions with machines. In particular, connection to the fields of
cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning will be a priority.
The prediction of human behavior in a machine interaction sense requires
greater understanding of the mind and the complexities of the human's internal
control scheme.

My primary goal will be do assemble a team of scientists (students, post docs,
and fellow collegues) to tackle research fundamental concepts in our
understanding of the human's control system and the machines that the human
interacts with. The applications are wide ranged but the research will
primarily focus on the basics of human motor control from simple balance to
manipulator control to vehicle control. I am interested in pushing the
boundaries into biofeeback in automatic control systems and operator
"awareness".

In my tenure as a graduate student researcher I have already gained a great
deal of experience in project management, student mentoring, and successful
grant writing. The final years of my graduate work was funded by an National
Science Foundation grant, of which I played a large role in writing and
managing under my principal investigators. Combining this with successful
grants from the Department of State (Fulbright), many local UC Davis grants,
and two Google Summer of Code grants, I feel quite prepared to secure funding
and management a large lab and several research projects.

When does the automatic take control of the vehicle if the human isn't up to
the control task? Can automatic control constantly be aware of the human's
state such that it can adapt to the human's ability or inability? Can machines
become aware of their surroundings such that they never harm a human? Autmoatic
control of manually controlled systems must be able to augment the human's
actions both enhacing their ability and filling in when the human loses the
ability to be an adequate controller. It should be aware of things the human
cannot be.

Research Proposals
==================

The following give brief proposals for research projects ideas and seeds.

Manual Control and Human Machine Interaction
--------------------------------------------

I'd like to explore the human as a machine controller for very fundamental
problems. For example, how do we balance a broom stick on our hand? What is the
fundamental sensory information that we take in, how we process that, and
produce the correct control action. Developing experiments around simple
input/output relationships with machines and software can help expose the
essense of human control.

In constract to simple systems and first principles modeling cosntructs, the
collection of a large amount of varying dynamic data from forces and kinematics
to psyiological sensations combined with machine learning and system
identication will allow for the development of predictive models of human
control behavior in complex tasks.

Cheap UAVs offer a new complex platform for testing helicopter dynamics.

Balance
-------

One of the most fundamental control tasks we do as a human is to balance.
Balancing is learned at a very young age when it is a task that dominates the
frontal cortex computations but which becomes a learned skill which moves to
the spinal cord. I'd like to study details of postrual control and the way in
which we learn the skill through carefully crafted experiments that can expose
the sensory motor control the human uses in balancing.

Single Track Vehicle Dynamics
-----------------------------

Single track vehicles such as bicycles, motorcycles, unicycles offer a unique
platform to study and understand human control. These vehicles limit the
human's input sources to affect the vehicles behavior which allow for more
controlled input/output experimental reslationsips t be studied. Furthermore
the vehicles themselves have non-trivial open loop dynamics which provides a
rich system for exposing the human's unique control abilities such as
non-minimum phase, instabilty, and directional control.

Vehicle and Machine Handling Qualities
--------------------------------------

When human's interact with machines whether it be flying an aircraft or playing
a video game there is feel, a subjective opinion on the ease of control. Does
the machine do what I want it to with minimal effort? The performance while
completing a task with a manually control machine and the machines open loop
dynamics can be objectively measured. There must be connections between the the
subjective feeling and the objective measurements. Unlocking this connection
will allow for the design of machines that compliment the human in a passive
way and in combination with automatic control will allow machines to adapt
the machine's dynamics in response to the humans desires. But understanding
what makes a machine easy to control will take an interdiciplianry approach
that involves an understanding of dynamics, control, neuroscience, and
pyschology.

Vehicle Model Software and Database
-----------------------------------

Scientists create models of vehicles constantly. There are well known models
like the "bicycle" model for cars, the Pacjeka automobile tire model, the
Whipple bicycle model, the Sharp motorcycle model, etc. The currently
availabilty of free an unhindered use of these models detracts from the
scientific community being able to trust resutls. A large database that allowed
models to developed, submitted and validated for easy reuse will. I'd like to
start with vehicle models, but this concept can extend to any system described
by differential equations and such.

Vehicle Simulation Database
---------------------------

Dynamics data is constantly collected on different vehilcles but is only stored
locally on scientists computers. If there were an easy way to stored time
series measurements with accompanying meta data, a large database of
simulations could be built up. This would allow modelers to validate their
models against thousands and thousands of simulations. In my field, most models
are accepted after being validated on only a tiny set of data. Imagine if you
could validate your model on huge datasets of simulations.

Bicycle Tire Modeling
---------------------

The rigid body dynamics bicycles and motorcycles have advanced enough for most
prediction abiliaties, but the most glaring deficiency is models that can
accurately predict the ground reaction forces between a tire and the surface
that it is rolling on. I'm interested in creating large amounts of tire force
data and identifiying models for validation and creation of first principles
models.

Open Source Software
--------------------

The academic needs powerful cutting edges computation tools at his or her
disposal. In academia, I believe that these tools are best provided by open
source software that is collaboratively developed among the leading scientists
in the field. The nature of open source software parallels the idea of
reproducible, reusable science. I've spent a great deal of time working on open
source software as a tightly knit companion to my research. All of my research
will have open source software as an integral component and here are some
specific examples of projects:

- Dynamics (problem development, simulation, and visualization)
- Symbolic equation of motion generation for dynamic systems
- Control Systems
- System Identification

I'm interested in developing reusale, tested open source software suites that
leverage cloud computing resources to solve big problems in my field, but to
have the software general enough that many other fields will use the software.

Big Data For Engineers
----------------------

The web has caught on to the big data movement, but much of the engineering
world is still behind the times. It is obvious that the more data we We now
have the capability for data driven models and predictions of physical
phenomina by making use of vast database stores and cloud powered computing
resources.

Data Sharing For Engineers
--------------------------

The vehicle simulation database and model database can evenutally be expanded
to other fields.

Human Inertia
-------------

Develop more realistic mathematical models for human inertia. Current rigid
body models do not accurate model the human intertia around the joints when in
arbitrary configurations. The need for more complex volumetric equations
defining the flexible regions around the primary joints can increase the
accuracy of human inertia esitmation in arbtrary configurations.

Segmented density areas within segements.

Validation of inertia models

Human power
-----------

Machines that are controlled with the human need to be aware of the human and
continously adapt to the human's varying control. We need to combine the best
of automatic control and the best of manual control to produce synergesitc
systems that best perform.

Energetics of Transportation
----------------------------

- Speed limits per vehicle kinetic energy
- GPS controlled Speed limit
- Self drving cars
- Efficient route choices based on the energetics of travel

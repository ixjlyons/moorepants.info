Research Statement
==================

If one word can represent the glue that binds my research concepts and
intentions it would be "human". With a mechanical engineering focus, my
predominant interests are based around various ways humans interact with
machines and how human's can be desscribed as a machine themselves. Although
past decades of mechanical engineering advancement have made great strides in
automatic control and machine design, this body of research often neglects the
intimate association between humans and machines. This relationship exists now
and will be for much of the foreseeable future. As machines develop to take on
more complicated tasks, they will need to become more aware their environment,
especially the human's actions and intentions, resulting in a system where the
human's higher cerebral control are complemented by massive data parsing and
repetitive tasks that computers excel at. In order to design devices that
optimize this balance we must better understand how people interact with their
environment. Such advanced technologies have recently come to light in the form
of self driving cars, assistive aircraft control, haptic feedback, human aware
factory robots, etc. The more we understand how the human behaves the better
these devices can be designed to complement the human's strengths.

My doctoral dissertation work focused on the human's unique ability to balance
a mostly unstable vehicle, the bicycle. The bicycle control problem is an ideal
platform for investigating many, if not all, of the facets of complex human
control and complementary machine design, all in a tractable, economically
viable, and familiar machine. On-board data acquisition has improved
dramatically with the advent and rapid growth of micro and nano sensor and data
collection abilities in small devices such as smart phones, which is helping
propel engineering into a big data field. This sensor and data collection
allowed me to collect substantial amounts of data from both the bicycle and the
human subject in maneuvering experiments. I made use of a combination of first
principles modeling techniques and grey box system identification approaches to
develop realistic models of both the bicycle and the human's control behavior.
This research is covered in detail in my `dissertation
<http://moorepants.github.com/dissertation>`_ and a series of journal and
conference papers listed in my resume.

My doctoral work has developed my aptitude in a broad range of theoretical and
experimental sub-disciplines including:

- Multibody dynamics and classical mechanics
- Classical and modern automatic control systems
- System identification
- Signal processing
- Human biomechanics
- Human operator control (i.e. manual control)
- Vehicle dynamics (single track vehicles, automobiles, and aircraft)
- Aircraft dynamics and control
- Vehicle handling qualities
- Open source software engineering and agile development
- Statistical modeling
- Machine design
- Sports engineering
- Appropriate technology
- Human powered machines
- Wind tunnel experimentation
- Mobile instrumentation

My future research directions will leverage collaborative initiatives to fill
gaps in my expertise and to develop a more holistic research plan centered
around the human as a controller and his or her interactions with machines. In
particular, collaboration and connection to the fields of cognitive psychology,
neuroscience, and machine learning will be a priority as the prediction of
human behavior while interacting with a machine requires greater understanding
of the human mind and internal control scheme complexities.

My primary goal will be to assemble a team of scientists (students, post docs,
and fellow colleagues) to tackle fundamental concepts in our understanding of
the human control system and the machines a person interacts with. The
applications are wide ranged but the research will primarily focus on the
basics of human motor control from simple balance to manipulator control and
vehicle control. I want to push the boundaries in understanding biofeedback in
automatic control systems and the controller's operator "awareness".

Questions I plan to seek answers for include: When does the automatic take
control of the vehicle if the human isn't up to the control task? Can automatic
control constantly be aware of the human's state such that it can adapt to the
human's ability or inability? Can machines become aware of their surroundings
such that they never harm a human? Automatic control of manually controlled
systems must be able to augment the human's actions both enhancing their ability
and filling in when the human loses the ability to be an adequate controller.
It should be aware of the environment when the human cannot be.

During my tenure as a graduate student researcher I gained a great deal of
experience in project management, student mentoring, and successful grant
writing. The final years of my graduate work was funded by a National Science
Foundation grant, of which I played a large role in writing and managing under
my principal investigators, Dr Mont Hubbard and Dr. Ronald Hess.  Combining
this with successfully obtaining grants from the Department of State including
a Fulbright, many local UC Davis grants, and two Google Summer of Code grants,
I feel quite prepared to secure funding and manage a large lab and many
simultaneous research projects.

Research Proposals
==================

Below I provide brief proposals for research projects ideas that I'd like to
pursue.

Manual Control and Human Machine Interaction
--------------------------------------------

I would like to explore the human as a machine controller for very fundamental
problems. For example, how do we balance a broom stick on our hand? To answer
this question, we need to consider the fundamental sensory information that we
take in, how we process that and produce the correct control action. Developing
experiments around such simple input/output relationships with machines and
software can help expose the essence of human control.

In contrast to simple systems and first principles modeling constructs, the
collection of a large amount of varying dynamic data from forces and kinematics
to psychological inputs combined with machine learning and system
identification will allow for the development of predictive models of human
control behavior in both simple and complex tasks.

Balance
-------

One of the most fundamental control tasks we do as a human is to balance.
Balancing is learned at a very young age; a task that initially dominates the
computations in the frontal cortex which later becomes a learned skill and the
computations move to the spinal cord. I'd like to study details of postural
control and the way in which we learn the skill through carefully crafted
experiments that can expose the sensory motor control the human uses in
balancing.

Single Track Vehicle Dynamics
-----------------------------

Single track vehicles such as bicycles, motorcycles, unicycles offer a unique
platform to study and understand human control. These vehicles limit the
human's input sources to affect the vehicle's behavior which allow for more
controlled input/output experimental relationships. Furthermore, the vehicles
themselves have non-trivial open loop dynamics which provides a rich system for
exposing the human's unique control abilities such as non-minimum phase,
instability, disturbance recovery, and directional/tracking control. This
research can have impacts on basic human operator control theory and on the
design of the vehicles themselves, for improved safety and optimal
characteristics for maneuvering.

Vehicle and Machine Handling Qualities
--------------------------------------

When humans interact with machines, whether it be flying an aircraft or playing
a video game, the operator has a subjective opinion on the ease of control. For
example, does the machine do what I want it to with minimal effort? Although
machine performance during a manually controlled task and the machines open
loop dynamics can be objectively measured, there must be connections between
the subjective feeling and these objective measurements. Unlocking this
connection will allow for the design of machines that compliment the human in a
passive way by changing their open loop dynamics through machine design and
furthermore, if knowledge of handling qualities is combined with automatic
control the machine in response to the human's desires without modifying the
vehicle's physical design. But developing theoretical models that describe a
machine's easy of control will take an interdisciplinary approach that involves
an understanding of dynamics, control, neuroscience, and psychology.

Vehicle Model Software and Database
-----------------------------------

Scientists and engineers constantly are creating a variety of dynamical models
of vehicles. In my field, there are well known models like the "bicycle" model
for cars, the Pacjeka automobile tire model, the Whipple bicycle model, the
Sharp motorcycle model, etc. The current unavailability of free and unhindered
use of these models detracts from the scientific community being able to trust
and reproduce results. A large database that allows models to be developed,
submitted, and validated for easy reuse will allow models to be validated
against data on a really large scale. I'd like to start with vehicle models,
but this concept can extend to any system described by differential algebraic
equations. I would build off of other open modeling languages and standards,
such as Modelica, to provide some of the framework needed to make this a
reality.

Vehicle Simulation Database
---------------------------

Dynamic data is constantly collected on different vehicles but is only stored
locally on scientists' computers. If there was an easy way to store time
series measurements with accompanying meta data, a large database of
simulations could be built up. This would allow modelers to validate their
models against thousands and thousands of simulations. In my field, most models
are accepted after being validated on only a tiny set of data. Imagine if you
could validate your model on huge datasets of simulations.

Bicycle Tire Modeling
---------------------

The rigid body dynamics of bicycles and motorcycles have advanced enough for
relatively good prediction abilities, but the most glaring deficiency is models
that can accurately predict the ground reaction forces between a tire and the
surface that it is rolling on. I'm interested in creating large amounts of tire
force data and identifying models for validation and creation of first
principles models.

Open Source Software
--------------------

The academic needs powerful cutting edges computation tools at his or her
disposal. Especially in academia, I believe these tools are best provided
through open source software collaboratively developed among leading scientists
and primary users in the field. The nature of open source software parallels
the idea of reproducible, reusable science. I have spent a great deal of time
working on open source software and it is tightly knit into my research. I
would like all of my research to have open source software as an integral
component. Some specific examples of projects I have been working on and have
in mind are given below:

- Dynamics (problem development, simulation, and visualization)
- Symbolic equation of motion generation for dynamic systems
- Control Systems
- System Identification

I am interested in developing reusable, highly tested open source software
suites that leverage cloud computing resources to solve computationally large
problems in my field, but to have software general enough so that researchers
from many other fields can make use of it and contribute.

Big Data For Engineers
----------------------

The world wide web has caught on to the big data movement and it drives
prediction and analyses on a grand scale, but much of the engineering world is
still behind the times. It is obvious that the more data we collect about
systems in the world, the more realistic and predictive our models can become.
We now have the capability for data driven models and predictions of physical
phenomena by making use of vast database stores and cloud powered computing
resources. Engineering needs to embrace this and make big data widely
accessible to engineers so that society can more rapidly make great strides in
solving problems. All of my future work will have a data component that
supports this idea.

Human Inertia
-------------

I'd like to develop more realistic mathematical models for human inertia.
Current rigid body models do not accurately model the human inertia around the
joints when in arbitrary configurations. The need for more complex volumetric
equations defining the flexible regions around the primary joints can increase
the accuracy of human inertia estimation in arbitrary configurations. These
models which have low computational and measurement latency should be validated
against more detailed and time consuming measurement techniques like MRI and
vibration analyses.

Human power
-----------

Humans are power generators and there are a great deal of ways to efficiently
make use of the human's mechanical power generation abilities to do work.
Human's have long used tools of various efficiencies for agriculture and food
processing. Making these processes most efficient are still important for much
of the developing world. Improves in efficiency of tasks such as transporting
people and goods, moving water, grinding raw foods, washing clothes, etc are
all possible. But also with the advent of extremely low power electronics (less
than 5w) the human's excess power can potentially keep things like cell phones,
pace makers, an small computers powered.

Energetics of Transportation
----------------------------

Transportation research and modeling techniques do not always take full
advantage of the predictive ability of the laws of motion. Utilizing
simulations of dynamically constrained systems can add great insight in
understanding transportation systems and giving results that are useful to
engineers, planners, and policy makers.

- Speed limits per vehicle kinetic energy
- GPS controlled speed limits
- Self drving cars
- Efficient route choices based on the energetics of travel
- Fuel economy feedback reformulated with energy economy in mind
